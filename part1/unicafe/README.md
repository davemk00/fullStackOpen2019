## Part 1.6 - Unicafe


**First Commit** - uniface step1

Making the page work, with three buttons and just three statistics



**Second Commit** - uniface step2

Adding more statistics
It is done in a simple way, but should be refactored to use 'Total' variable to make cleaner


**Third Commit** - uniface step3

Moved statistics into its own component
new 'all' const to make maths cleaner
I suppose I could use some maths functions/methods



**Fourth Commit** - uniface step4

Added 'no feedback given' routine
